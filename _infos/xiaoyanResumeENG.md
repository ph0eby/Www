Key Achievements

(1) Business Work

Has Been engaged in 12 years of liquid separation membrane product quality inspection and testing.

 As the director of membrane detection, it is mainly responsible for the maintenance, updating and verification of the software and hardware systems related to membrane detection; the development and validation of methods; extension and maintenance; and laboratory matching and capability verification
 Three years of participation (2010,2011,2015) to undertake a special inspection of the quality supervision of membrane products of General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine organizations
 A "standardized experimental small component and its rapid pouring method" was developed
Four series of automatic membrane detection devices have been developed
 15 kinds of ultrafiltration membranes were selected and valued for evaluation of retained substances
A method for the detection of ultrafiltration membrane cutting molecular weight was developed
 A "system software for the issuance of testing reports" was developed
 Responsible for leading the establishment of the center's first official business, the wechat public, "ultrafiltration membrane detection technology platform"

Operational work in 2018(updated as at 21 June 2018) :

Independent completion of 90 pressure calibrations (since mid-march, I have been in charge of pressure sensor calibration)
 To cooperate in the calibration of 72 temperature and salinity projects;
 A total of 66"calibration certificates" were issued separately
 A special computing software for the N value of certificates has been developed. A (N value of the WQM instrument t and C) has been completed and distributed to all laboratory members

(4) scientific research projects

Research and development of Hollow Fiber ultrafiltration Membrane Performance Detection Technology Platform
The project is a 2011 marine commonweal project with a total cost of 8.92 million yuan.
 Four automatic film detection devices have been developed as the main designers
15 truncated substances were selected for selection. It is determined that 15 kinds of interceptions from thousands to hundreds of thousands of molecules basically cover all the requirements for the determination of ultrafiltration membrane aperture in the market
A method for the detection of ultrafiltration membrane cutting molecular weight was developed
 Responsible for leading the establishment of the first official business of my center, the wechat public.

Study on evaluation index system and test method of ultrafiltration membrane
The project is a General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine Quality Assurance Project for 2008, with a funding of 560,000 yuan.
 Based on the method of online and offline research, we obtain the product technical index which is of concern to manufacturers and users of uf films at home and abroad
 An experimental method for bacterial interception of Hollow Fiber ultrafiltration membrane was established

Research and development of phosphate standard materials for Marine Water Matrix
The project is part of the National Quality Foundation (Nqi) project in 2016, which aims to develop a range of concentrations of sea-water-based phosphate-standard substances, primarily to calibrate marine phosphate sensors. Starting in 2016, the project is expected to take four years to complete the development of four concentrations of standard materials. My Division of Labor in this project is:
Research: The organisation completed two research activities on Xiamen University and Tianjin University of Science and Technology
 Study on the preparation method and sterilization technology of the samples of the Seawater Matrix. The research and acquisition of marine water sterilization barrels, ultraviolet sterilization lamps and so on
 Responsible for the post-stability evaluation of the standard material


Operational work in 2018(updated as at 21 June 2018) :

By the end of the 201806, three batches of 100 samples were made
